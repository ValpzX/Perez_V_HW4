    <h2>Assignment Requirements</h2>

    <p>Follow the steps described below to update the ToDo list using CSS.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Add a background image of some kind to the page - theme it however you like, but it should have something to do with a "to-do" list.</li>

        <li>Add a header to the page and use an H1 tag (and others, if you like) to give your page a creative title. Use an ID attribute and CSS selector to style the header and its content.</li>

        <li>Use generic element selectors, IDs, and classes where appropriate and make the build your own - change colours, fonts, etc. Feel free to explore Google Fonts as a solution.</li>

        <li>Add an input element with a type of checkbox to each "in progress" and each "done" list item in the "in progress" and "done" lists.</li>

        <li>When you check an "in-progress" list item, use the appropriate selector to also / additionally select the entire list item's content and set their colour appropriately.</li>

        <li>When you check a "done" item, use the appropriate selector to also / additionally select the entire list item's content and set their colour appropriately.</li>

        <li>Use the ::after pseudo selector to add a graphic element indicating completion (check, thumbs up, etc.)</li>
    </ol>
